RAMPAGE: (*fRAMework to comPAre aGd dEtectors*) is a framework aimed at training and comparing machine learning models for the detection of Algorithmically Generated Domains (AGDs).

## Installation

RAMPAGE runs on Python 3.11. To use RAMPAGE, it is necessary to create a pip package and install it. For now, it has been decided not to upload it to PyPI.

To generate the package, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

The package will be generated in the `dist/` directory. To install it, use pip to install the file with the `.whl` extension that has been created. E.g.:

```
pip3 install dist/RAMPAGE-1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Usage

In the `examples/` directory, there is a sample execution that includes a series of models. Below is an explanation of how to set them up.

### Requirements

It is necessary to install the packages of the machine learning frameworks used in examples. To do this, execute the following command (it is recommended to use a virtualized Python environment):"

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Example of use

#### `main.py`

The `main.py` file contains the primary execution code. It should import RAMPAGE and DatasetManager class.

```python
from RAMPAGE.Framework import Framework
from PersonaldatasetManager import PersonalDatasetManager
```

Next, DatasetManager is then defined within RAMPAGE, and the datasets to be used are added.

```python
# Create Framework
framework = Framework()
# Create DatasetManager1 implementation
datasetManager = PersonalDatasetManager()
# Set percentajes to use in train, validation and test
datasetManager.setPercentages(70,15,15)
# Set in framework the dataset to use
framework.defineDatasetManager(datasetManager)
# Add dga dataset
framework.addDataset(PATH_DGA, True)
# Add Non dga dataset
framework.addDataset(PATH_NON_DGA, True)
```

The next step is to define the classifiers, train, and test them.

```python
# Define classifiers
classifiers = [
    LSTM_example,
    CNN_example,
    Baseline_example
]
for classifier in classifiers:
    classifierObj = classifier()
    framework.addClassifier(classifierObj)
# Train all classifiers
framework.train()
# Test all classifiers
framework.test()
```

After executing the classifier tests, we can retrieve and display the results.

```python
# Get results
results = framework.getResults()
# Show results
for i in range(len(results)):
    print(framework.getClassifierByIndex(i).__class__.__name__)
    print(framework.getResultByIndex(i).toString())
```

#### Datasets Definition

For managing datasets, two classes need to be considered: DataElement and DatasetManager. DataElement represents a single unit with all its features. In the base version, it only includes the domain and a boolean indicating whether the domain should be classified as malicious or not. If new fields or features need to be added, two new classes must be created, inheriting from DataElement and DatasetManager, respectively.

In DataElement, you need to add as many attributes to the class as the number of features you want to include. In DatasetManager, the parseDataElement function must be overridden so that it can read the new fields of the updated DataElement.

#### Result

`Result` class is special, as it is empty by default. Therefore, a new class that inherits from `Result` should be created, where the desired metrics for the statistics to be measured will be implemented. E.g.:


```
class ResultPersonal(Result):

    def __init__(self, accuracy, precision, recall):
        self.accuracy = accuracy
        self.precision = precision
        self.recall = recall

    def toString(self) -> str:
        ret = " * Accuracy   -> " + str(self.accuracy) + "\n"
        ret = ret + " * Precision  -> " + str(self.precision) + "\n"
        ret = ret + " * Recall     -> " + str(self.recall)
        return ret
    
    def toCSVheader(self, separator:str) -> str:
        ret = "accuracy" + separator + "precision" + separator + "recall"
        return ret

    def toCSV(self, separator:str) -> str:
        ret = str(self.accuracy) + separator + str(self.precision)
        ret = ret + separator + str(self.recall)
        return ret
```

#### Classifier

The classifiers inherit from the `RAMPAGE.Classifier` class. To do so, they must implement the train and test functions. A proposed implementation could be as follows:

```python
class Example(Classifier):

    #Define your configuration values
    ...

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        # Define your model
        ...
        
    def train(self, train:set, validation:set):
        # Define your training method
        ...


    def test(self, test:set) -> Result:
        ...
        return PersonalResult(...)
```
